Staff were rude and ignorant, I waited over 5 hours my first visit there while experiencing severe mental health issues (and was sat in a public waiting room while shaking and crying that entire 5 hours) only to leave without ANY treatment on my own accord after numerous attempts to make staff aware and wary of the fact I was an increasing risk to myself and others and that I was fearful I would lose control. \nWell I guess after a 5 hour wait, watching people who came in with genuinely minor ailments one by one all go before me to be treated. I did. I did become a danger to others in that house hospital and myself, I ended up yelling at a staff member who wouldn't even listen to me when I was trying to say I was having suicidal thoughts and had started planning to go through with them and I left the hospital in such a state that I believe I should have most certainly been kept and observed at the absolute least before returning to be in the public's eye. \nIt was a seriously embarrassing and damaging experience for me and I don't believe I was treated fairly or with any care or respect. \nTo put myself (and everyone else at the hospital) in serious danger from an unpredictable and scared person and not in any way speak to them or isolate them in any way in inexcusable. \nWhat if I had hurt someone? What if I had killed myself? \nWell, two days after that occurance; i tried. I hung myself in the back yard of a home i was staying at over there and was taken right back to this hospital. Where for a SECOND TIME they completely failed me and this time, badly traumatised me for life.  I was pinned to the ground having both my shoulders dislocated by a police officer (whom I warned I had hyper mobility and pleaded with to stop hurting me over and over) while a staff member of the hospital came into the room, strapped me to a bed and COMPLETELY WITHOUT WARNING ME SHOT ME WITH A LARGE DOSE OF KETAMINE. I was not informed that it had even happened nor what substance was shoved into my body and I had a terrifying adverse reaction to it that I can not even put into words still to this day. \nI, shaking and terrified, told the staff about what I had experienced and even made a nurse stand and hold my hand until I could breathe properly again and stopped hallucinating. That was at least a 15 minute to half hour window of time where I was more scared than I had ever been in my entire life. \nI was given TWO MORE shots at the same dosage via needle with out any sort of consent and in fact a threat to pursue legal action if they continued to administer a drug to me that I clearly did not respond to normally or in a good way what so ever. \nI understand I was irate and acting abnormally when I got the first one and excuse that as a poorly handled situation. But, making an unstable and extremely fearful patient, even more fearful and unstable three times over when they became completely complacent after the first instance as not to have to experience it ever again, is sick. It is absolutely disgusting and I still have nightmares on a constant basis. \nWhen I am financially able, I plan to pursue such matters in court and hopefully get whoever made the awful decisions regarding my \"care\" at the hospital the hell fired so they don't traumatise any more young adults in crisis! \nIf I could give minus stars, I would.\nStorm C.T. 21 year old female", "time": 1536880976}]}, {"name": "Ballarat Day Procedure Centre", "place_id": "ChIJIw-q7XBE0WoR3Zfr16BdYWk", "rating": 5, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Kara Cook", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101175105971683988867/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vhR1huJ8Soc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdGENsFvJxD0rLatPwDHj6KA1A8kQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Brilliant staff, stress free experiance due to their professionalism, nice and clean aswell", "time": 1505109762}, {"author_name": "Melissa Aldenhoven", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110246606392962255355/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eYpFF_kjZPs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/8XA0wt0e-qY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Fast, friendly and Professional.

As the days went by, I didn't receive one phone call and  even during personal visits it was a challenge to find out what was happening. Clearly, as her next of kin, primary carer, enduring guardian and medical power of attorney, I had the right to be kept up to date .\n\nFinally, I was summoned to a meeting  and advised that the powers that be at the hospital had decided that my mother should / would be committed to a nursing home.  However, there were a few problems. First of all, she didn't want to go into such a place. Secondly, I wouldn't agree to it. And, most significantly, her GP,  with whom we had regular contact including home visits, stated that such a move wasn't necessary. When I wouldn't comply, Caulfield seemed to retaliate by steadfastly refusing to discuss the subject of when she could leave. In other words, she would be held hostage until I agreed to their demands. A lawyer who was involved with a seniors rights advocacy group, quickly informed me that the hospital did not have the legal power to take such a course of action. In fact, what they were trying to do was a direct violation of patient rights.\n\nWe became locked into a stand off situation which dragged on for several weeks during which time my mother became increasingly distressed and disorientated. Every conceivable obstacle, excuse and delaying tactic was thrown in the way to prevent her from leaving .  \n\nWhen her own doctor was able to establish that there was no medical reason for her to be detained any longer, I made the decision to discharge her . Ward staff then provoked a yelling match in her room which reduced her to tears. \n\nIn a last-ditch effort to impose their will onto us, the hospital then tried to have me removed from the picture as the power of attorney and guardian by making a concerted (but unsuccessful) attempt to discredit my performance as a carer. \n\nWe ended up going to VCAT . An investigation was carried out by the Office of the Public Advocate which included interviewing around a dozen witnesses. The findings of that investigation obviously left the tribunal member with no doubt that the hospital was in the wrong and the case was decided in our favor. Not only did the relevant managers  at Caulfield repeatedly refuse to accept my authority as being my mother's legally appointed decision maker, they also tried to deny both of us our legal rights and completely disregarded our wishes.  But , perhaps most alarmingly,  when the real trouble began they appeared to make a deliberate attempt to cover up their unacceptable conduct.\n\nMy advice to other carers who find themselves in a similar situation is to know you rights. Also,  insist that both your own wishes and those of the person you are caring for are respected and don't allow the hospital to forcibly take control of the decision making through a process of bullying and intimidation.  \n\nEven though the hospital may believe that they are acting in the best interests of the patient, trying to institutionalize someone without good reason is a very serious matter.\n\nPerhaps we were just unlucky and ours was a one - off case. Hopefully, others have had much more positive dealings with Caulfield Hospital.", "time": 1549572940}, {"author_name": "Julie Band", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108780592999810661725/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yaAVY6EZxZE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3revz80T96n0c7j9CHMk1WB8lYRZrw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Fabulous staff .caring understanding\n.unfortunately its in urgent need if an internal face lift..

I am not sure how they  call themselves a hospital, let alone a private one?\n\nDon't bother going there,unless you want to loose your pride& dignity and end up with a broken spirit.\n\nI've had the worst experience ever in this place,where I spent time from 6th of February till the 19th.\n\nI recently been transferred to this hospital from another great one,where I've had a hysterectomy & removal of the mesh in that area.\n Unfortunately  I had a secondary complication, a blockage in the bowel which required me being transferred here based on the bowel surgeon 's request, because that's where he  operates.\n\nFirstly, let me thank the team of two surgeons,, the physician,the digestive health doctor&the two dietitians, who dropped in every day to check on me, they virtually saved my life, after being fed through machines, tubes, antibiotics, drips ETC...This is where it stops. Unfortunately,I've hit a brick wall dealing with nurses on daily basis!\n\nThey're  so inconsistent& don't handover files properly.\n\nThere were two which were caring& knowledgeable& don't mind giving patients the care they need and deserve.thank you Tim& Kim, in my opinion you  were the cream of the crop.\n\nThe second category is, about six others which didn't mind doing their job pleasantly.\n\nThe third category were the hand ballers, they always say: I'll come back, but they never do, they leave it to the next shift to handle!\n\nThe fourth& weakest link were the basic one's  , who adopt the attitude of: I don't know or, we don't have that ! This gives them the minimal work.HELLO...What happened to asking someone else if you don't know?\n\nFor those of you who understand that when you've just had two traumas together& being attached to to machines,YOU NEED HELP!\n\nAll these medications, sends you to the toilet more often! On my first night , I asked the nurse if I could have some wipes to clean myself after having many accidents? The answer was: we don't have them. I had no option but to grab some Dettol wipes from my bag and used them , on an area which had too many external stitches till I had blisters& started bleeding from my pelvic floor area.\n\nAlso some would know after a hysterectomy, you're not supposed to push heavy equipment many times over, from your bedroom to your bathroom. I called the nurse twice in a hurry for some help, she made a point to ask: why do you go to the toilet often?Nothing to stop you from pulling the cord from the wall and go by yourself.( Note, the cord was about a meter above my head). They obviously, don't bother to read your files and see what sort of help you do need?\nThe next time I needed to go to the toilet, I had no option but to sit & cry for one hour with a soiled and wet pants, because I was too scared to press the buzzer.\n\nTim, the night shift nurse was passing in the corridor& heard me crying, he came in & asked what's wrong?I told him, he went and got some wipes & gel to treat the area. It was readily available behind the nurses station apparently.\n\nThe next morning I had Kim,  It was God's sent to me. she helped me shower& treated me herself, I told her that I was running out of undies& don't know what to do? she went and got me some disposables .\n\nanother time they, left me for two hours screaming with pain ,didn't bother   ringing the doctors to check!\n\n she could've given me panadol  through the line,  or morphine injection had she checked the file properly?\n I had to ring the surgeon myself.\nlater one came,  they told him that I was complaining because I was hungry. Good liers too!\nAlso the food monitor was the worst I've ever come across too, despite requests from the dietitians for her to come up, she kept sending  what she wants.\nAll the staff from x ray, food services, cleaners& wheel chair transport, very helpful.\nI invite the complaints manager to get in touch with me& discuss this further, also I will be reporting this to my health insurance, that's Unacceptable!\nI had to ask for the pick line to be removed on discharge! \n\nlook forward to hear from you\nthanks\n\nSuzy Dahouk", "time": 1552272782}, {"author_name": "Bridie", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117223935264066474570/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_RHmslT3u4g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAg/bkTcDoeKshI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Cannot thank staff here enough.

I spent sometime in this clinic and it has its pros and cons. I will start with the positives: it's a nice small clinic, most of the staff are really friendly. 2 nurses in particular are probably the most kindest caring psych nurses I have ever met. They have a 7 day program which is good so there is something everyday. The psychiatrists are good - well mine anyway, but I found it weird they have no female psychiatrists? Well none I was aware of anyway as I asked on admission. The groups are quite good but I feel they need a bit more variety as everyone is different. Food is good, make it there themselves. Out of the private psych hospitals in Melbourne this is probably the nicest, and It would be the one I recommend of all private hospitals. It's quite family like, a beautiful therapy dog and you can bring pets to visit!! \nThe negatives ( I don't want this to discourage people... I am kind of hoping the management may read this and look at it as things they need to review) at times they can be really short staffed which makes it hard for patients and the staff. Sometimes I felt the nurses could be more engaging with the patients.. I understand it's voluntary treatment and it is up to the patient to seek help and say what they need, but sometimes a very depressed or anxious patient may find this difficult - I just feel the staff could be a little more encouraging and just take a bit of time and patience and perserverance to chat, I sometimes thought this was due to them being short staffed and they always had something else to be doing (ie meds, obs, admissions, notes) but sometimes you would walk past the nurse station and they would just be chatting to each other. They have a lot of agency nurses too which can make it difficult you feel every day you are reintroducing yourself and your problems. I felt the focus was a bit on making money not being 100% committed to helping patients - hence the short staffing. I noticed once there was a sign in the office for the night staff and it said \"most importantly spend quality time with patients\" - I don't think I ever once had a night nurse spend time with me - only ever checked me every so often in the night. I remember there was a young girl there who was really shy and anxious and she never seemed to improve much while I was there and I always thought was this because she was too shy to ask for help so the staff just kind of left her. This I think is what I mean by staff could be more engaging and encouraging - if there were enough of them. \nAfter being in a few psych wards I really feel that this place could be fantastic if they had more staff and it was a bit more organised- a full time psychologist with experience in a range of psychiatric illnesses and the staff and management were more patient orientated - I don't mean that in a nasty way, I just always had a feeling while I was there that the staff were mostly just there to get paid and the management was more concerned about money. \nI know it is a new place, but the unit was never full, probably only ever half full. In my opinion if they spent more money now getting it up and going really well with well equiped staff and a great therapy program then it would be hands down the most fantastic place, get great reviews and more people would know about it and seek admission there and they would be full all the time = making good profit probably. \nOh and you really need to fix the hot water and washing machine!!!!\nNevertheless, I will recommend this place to anyone I speak to that is seeking help. I whole heartedly thank the team there for help with my recovery.\nTake care", "time": 1533202522}, {"author_name": "Hvf5 Paul", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100834157945880986555/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AgDME0v12_E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEuM/xKOeCVJFweE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "At one stage this was a private hospital.

And when she spoke to me, she spoke so rudely. I tried to explain that I had other medical appointments to attend to and I could not attend the dates that she offered but she spoke to me with such callousness, insensitivity and coldness, I ended up booking with another Endoscopy Centre.

It is hard to change habits such as co-sleeping when there are tears involved but watching my child\u2019s progress from crying in her own cot at the start of the week to beginning to self settle tearlessly by the end of the week, I was relieved and grateful.\n\nIt was an emotional experience and hard to hear a fair bit of crying by my baby and others in nearby rooms. But by the end of the week there were a lot fewer tears. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle the tears at home as I\u2019d always intervene right away but with support it\u2019s worth it as the babies settle into their new routine and learn to self settle. A nurse pointed out that learning to be less anxious on your own without mom or dad being immediately available, is a skill children carry with them all through life such as on the first day of childcare or school. Learning this skill with mom or dad nearby in a supportive environment makes sense. \n\nI recommend it for those ready to give their babies the independence of a sleep routine and who may need it to get more sleep themselves. The staff were so supportive, knowledgeable and caring. The environment was comfortable and spacious with lots of toys, books and activities for the babies. There are resources for parents also including talks and counselling plus a BBQ for the dads. There were only 5 families in our section as the younger and slightly older babies are in separate areas, so it was easy to bond with the other moms without feeling crowded. There is no free wi-fi or TV but it made me focus on spending more quality time with my daughter, which was great.

I settled in with an open mind. Come Friday I spoke to the nurses (repeatedly), physio and OT wondering when I would be seeing Dr. Lim (my treating doctor), not an unreasonable request. \n\nI found out Friday evening that Dr. Lim would not be seeing me. He would most likely visit me sometime on Monday or Tuesday, 4-5 days after being admitted. Once I heard this I asked for an immediate discharge. This is verging on neglect and this type of behavior should be reported to AHPRA, complete lack of patient care.\n\nDr. Lim never made any effort to visit me once, despite allegedly being at the facility during my 28 hours stay. I expect that my treating doctor to come visit me once at least once within a 28 hour period, and if not, at least have the courtesy to give me a call and let me know he will tend to me shortly.\n\nI did see the 'GP' who stepped into my room at 7 am the first morning for 2 minutes. He was gone before I could even speak to him, he told me to speak to Dr. Lim.\n\nI often expressed concerns about the levels of pain medications and wanting a pain management plan to reduce my narcotic intake. I was told that Dr. Lim would have to manage that, someone who I had no access to.\n\nThe level of care by the nursing staff was of the highest standard, however, the level of care by the doctors is verging on neglect.\n\nI am a private patient, paying top money for service. Room 33 that I was allocated felt like I was in a prison. I was placed out the back, away from human contact, the room, despite recently renovated it was very unwelcoming. The bathroom facilities are substandard for a private facility my guess from the 70's to early 80's.\n\nI had to share a bathroom, which is not ideal but acceptable. The other patient was a pig, I'm sorry but I have no other word to best describe him. He would consistently leave fecal matter in the toilet for me to flush and left a fecal stain towel in the shower recess, where I was to shower. Outright disgusting and unhygienic.\n\nAfter requesting a discharge, I was meet my the head nurse, at the time she was pleasant and trying to defuse the situation at hand. She was adamant that I should stay one more night and that she will get in contact with Dr. Lim. \n\nI politely requested to leave, to which I was faced with objections by the head nurse that it was not possible, as no doctor was on the facility to discharge me and that they had no access to the pharmacy, which my medications I bought into the facility where kept. So, I had to stay.\n\nI didn't respond well to this and after a short firm discussion, asking if I was being kept here forcibly against my will, she managed to find a way to obtain my medications which took about 2 hours. It was clear the staff had no idea how to handle such a request.\n\nSince leaving, I have managed to reduce my narcotic pain safely by half over the weekend, while balancing and managing my withdrawal symptoms (I'm not new to this). I'm seeing my local GP today who will assist me in designing a pain management plan and seeing the practice nurse tending to my surgical wound.  \n\nI'm getting far better care from my local GP than what was provided by this facility at a fraction of the cost.\n\nI would not recommend this facility to anyone. \n\nIf you do plan on staying, I strongly suggest you visit the bedroom and bathroom you will be allocated to see if it's up to your standard (avoid room 33). I would also make sure that you meet the 'doctor' who will be caring for you before your visit to rehab. \n\nTo be fair, the main wing, which is a shared facility looks great, the outdoor rooms I would avoid.

Surgeon was great. The nurses and other staff were also very caring and attentive. The only complaints I have are to do with the lack of anything to do during my stay. \n\nFirst of all, most of my time was spent in bed on a CPM exercise machine. So basically 12 hours doing nothing but managing my pain and watching the tv above my bed. Unfortunately it could only get half a dozen channels of local tv (7 9 10 etc) I would have thought a private hospital would have provided something better. Even for an additional fee I would have been happy to pay for foxtel or Netflix etc. Which brings me to my second issue. \n\nI'd just come from a stay at The Avenue and St John of God hospitals. Both of those only have terrestrial tv. At both places I used my phone to stream Netflix etc and naturally thought I'd do the same here. No chance. The phone reception at Northpark Hospital is at best atrocious. I tried making a number of calls and every one of them was disconnected or failed to connect. No phone calls. No browsing. No emails and certainly no streaming. They need to install some signal booster or other hardware to help rectify this. They won't though. It's all about the money and they won't spend any unless they absolutely have to.\n\nOne final issue. The air conditioning. I shared a room with one other gentleman and there were a couple of very hot days. The room was hot and stuffy. I asked for the a/c to be turned on and, because the split system unit was above the other patients head, they had to get his approval before turning it on. Even then it made no difference to my side of the room because his dividing curtains were drawn. He soon got too cold and asked for it to be turned off. I had to ask for a cold pack to help cool me down. A very poor state of affairs to be honest. And not something I would expect to see in a private hospital.\n\nOh, and the food is pretty average.

He thought I had severe OCD. To be fair, when I first saw him, I thought too. But isn\u2019t that the job of a psychiatrist? To accurately (to the best of their abilities) assess and diagnose the patient\u2019s condition BEFORE treatment? Ended up being given a medication specifically for the above but had severe side effects resulting in admission to hospital for a second time. Turned out, I didn\u2019t have OCD at all.  This was confirmed by a clinical psychologist who has over 30 years of experience and 2 other psychiatrists. Both agreed that I didn\u2019t suffer from it, but was itself a symptom of my Aspergers, which by the way, he doubted I had.\n \nFor my first appointment, he was 50 minutes late and only gave a weak apology. During that time, he did not make much effort to try to get to know me. Instead, he requested that I asked my GP to fax him a copy of a previous psychiatrist\u2019s report and used that to get to know me instead. That report from the previous psychiatrist was 4 years old and most of it didn\u2019t apply to me anymore during that visit. Regardless, he only questioned me for a mere 15 minutes before coming to a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d, which turned out to be incorrect upon further consultation with other psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. \n\n Throughout the many months of seeing him, including in hospital, he keeps saying he\u2019ll \u201cleave no stones unturned\u201d and that I needed \u201cintense CBT\u201d. None of that happened, only the inpatient \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d who talked to me about music and other non-related topics when we ran out of stuff to discuss during our sessions. Referred me to Windermere and told me to go to group when I clearly found it not helpful at all after attending dozens of sessions. Dr G didn\u2019t do any CBT at all with me but left it to Dr Farnbach, whose one on one with me just lasted less than 5 minutes a time as he\u2019s not my official doctor. Everytime I see him, it\u2019s rush this rush that. There was no time to say or speak up. To be fair, it isn\u2019t Dr Farnbach\u2019s fault as he wasn\u2019t my psychiatrist and volunteered to help with ERP (a type of CBT) but isn\u2019t that the job of Dr Gallogly? Zero CBT done by Dr G as an inpatient and outpatient in the 6 or more months of seeing him.\n\nDuring my 2nd hospital visit, he seemed absent minded and forgetful. So much so that he forgot to write me a script for a medication which is of heavy dependence upon my discharge. Luckily, my GP agreed to write it. Otherwise, I would have been without it for the Christmas and New Year period. Following that, in the new year, his receptionist called to cancel an upcoming appointment due to him falling sick and promised she\u2019ll call me back to reschedule. This never happened. \n\nThe so called psychotherapist that he recommended was expensive, offered no Medicare rebates whatsoever and conducted our session in a tiny and cramped unit, with walls as thin as paper. The placement of a single chair outside her room as a makeshift waiting area was also another concern. Anyone could hear us talking whilst sitting outside, or as a matter of fact, even in the adjacent cramped toilet.", "time": 1554676244}, {"author_name": "Besham Hiloser", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103450496763324485965/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dzoA7hFZ08g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cWXd1RalJ_M/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "Health treatments don't work very well", "time": 1554868377}, {"author_name": "Aidrian Robson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105089016022407471364/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-m0xCuTnYyuc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACJ8/hgeC3Y3ciw0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Average health care provided.

She suffers from alzheimers too and had acute delirium. She also understands very little English.Although she couldn't participate in rehab due to her drowsy state, she was left bed ridden. A physio chair that had been provided was taken away and nobody knew where it was. She was left sitting in a chair all day with her feet dangling in mid air and with no foot stool. I was told this was ok by the  nurses despite my concerns .This eventually left her legs severely swollen and is now recovering by having them elevated. I had to point out the swelling because nobody seemed to notice. Eating and drinking was a nightmare and I had to attend to this myself. She only had two proper showers in the 3 weeks she was there by two lovely nurses. I don't even recall staff changing any bed linen either. Her vitals were down one night after a medical episode. The doctor decided to call me on my mobile while I'm at the hospital to tell me my mum was dying as she drove herself there but only to arrive and tell me she was OK now. Had no compassion at all and the place felt so impersonal.I still feel traumatised by this event.We need a  different system in place for those living with dementia and  suffering from other illness. The hospital system is ill equipped to deal with these specialized cases. My mother's condition went from bad to worse. I did not want her moved into their transition ward where I was told at St Vincent's will assist in her recovery. The place was narrow, small, dark and gloomy and hardly ideal for somebody with delirium to recover in.

After struggling through the settling process, Christine offered to assist and I said yes - she had our baby asleep in no time!  \n\nOnce settled, we went into another room to discuss the exercise - she shared her observations with us about our baby (eg. she noticed that if she couldn't see our faces, she became more agitated and therefore suggested we don't try and settle by placing her over our shoulder, and showed us a few alternative positions).  Being an in-home visit, we also benefitted greatly as her observations about the sleep environment have greatly contributed to our baby now self-settling (eg. positioning of the bassinet, darkness of the room, introduction of a white noise machine).  \n\nChristine went on to talk through any of our concerns and gave us suggestions on how to overcome these, as well as talking through with us the theory behind Tweddle's approach. She was realistic and also gave us some \"plan B\" strategies for the transition period which helped as these changes don't occur overnight.  \n\nSince her visit, the transformation has been overwhelming.  Baby now happily goes down for her naps during the daytime, sleeps overnight and is self-settling.  Further, if she is woken up during any of her sleeps, we now have the confidence in how to resettle her.  \n\nTweddle's approach aligned well with our approach to parenting, and not using the controlled crying method meant that we both felt comfortable with our new approach to baby's sleep.  We had a follow up call a few days later to check in, and had a follow up visit scheduled in a few weeks later, which we ended up declining as our baby took to the new routine and approach so well.  The team at Tweddle were incredibly supportive and available during the course of the process.  \n\nWe can't thank Tweddle enough for their help and support, and would recommend them highly for any parent with sleep issues.", "time": 1553740127}, {"author_name": "jela helen wroblewski", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116556960085303417275/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H_Gqvs9oHic/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfdU7-PxTXxNvksjME82Baa-44R9Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Were fantastic with my family.

I reported this to the triage nurse, also the fact that my blood pressure was over 180/120 and consistently so. There was also the possibility this related to a work place injury where last week I was assaulted and copped a knee to the ribs causing at least bruised ribs and a blow to the head. I reported this to the male nurse. The nurse displayed no empathy, no compassion and blew me off to the next window where the same level of service continued, merely ticking the boxes until I was told to wait in the waiting room. Now I am not sure if the person reading this has ever suffered from a migraine but I can tell you that the noise in the waiting room especially with the construction was going on was like torture. I approached after approx an hour of waiting the blonde haired nurse at triage, asking if there was somewhere quieter I could wait. She said no, nil compassion, nil empathy and like all the other staff at the ED window that morning blew me off. I also asked approx how long and was told I was next. I managed to wait another 45 minutes before it became to much, the pain unbearable and then approached the admin staff to inform them I was going. She wanted me to wait in line to speak to the triage nurse. I said no, I am leaving. I walked in severe pain to St John of God ED where I received prompt service, compassion, a great level of care and was through getting treatment within a very short time. I have had pleasant experiences at Geelong Hospital before but unfortunately some terrible ones too and yesterday was a disgrace. I am pretty sure none of those staff adhered to your organisations values yesterday. And just for the record I did not expect preferential treatment, merely a quieter place I could sit and wait.

If this was done, they had pre arranged agreements with Heritage and Heritage funerals for them to take the body.\n\nThere seemed to be no consideration in a palliative care facility that people die, unless of course you take into account the opportunity to profit from death and grief. \n\nHer entire care regime was based around anti psychotic medication and sedation despite the fact that she was not aggressive, agitated or otherwise difficult to manage.  With her cancer it made her comfortable to stand then to sit and to repeat this process.  This was considered agitation and the registrar believed this would lead to violent and aggressive behaviour.   She was diagnosed only a week to the day before with pancreatic and liver cancer.  I was sitting with her two days before she died when one of the nurses said she was going to give her something to calm her down.  I said she is calm!

He had an ultrasound and the doctor said there was fluid in his hip and it would resolve with nurofen and rest but to come back in 3 days if he wasn't walking and/or had a fever or vomiting. 3 days later he still wasn't walking and had developed a fever so we went back. A different doctor said there was no mention of fluid in his hip in the notes, that he had tonsilitis and suggested he was faking not being able to walk. He was unbelievably blase about my son, aggresive and rude. A nurse in emergency said I should stop pushing him in a pram and force him to walk and insinuated I was making up the fact he couldn't walk and that he was spoiled and manipulating me! She was incredibly rude and snide.
